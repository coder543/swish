Swish needs to be run with LuaJIT on a system that has libncurses available.

This is designed to demonstrate an ideal shell -- in a world where you know all available commands and completions, you can do wonderful things for usability of a terminal interface.

KNOWN BUGS:
if you backspace too far, it will crash.
if you enter a free-input region (like text or numbers) things break, but it still demos reasonably well.
